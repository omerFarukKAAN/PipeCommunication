# PipeCommunication
Operating Systems project

The subject of the project is to perform a cofactor calculation of 3x3 matrices entered into the system using interprocess communication. A random row or column value from the program called "SatSutSec" will be used. With this value, "KofakHesap2x2" program will work and calculate cofactor. Finally, the main program will print result of calculate.
